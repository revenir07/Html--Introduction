<ul>
   <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Open Communication:</li></dd>
         <dd>A good leader keeps an open line of communication with team members and can succinctly explain organizational goals and tasks using different types of communication channels,
             such as one-on-one sessions, email, video, chat, phone calls and social media. An effective leader also shares clear messages and makes complex ideas easy to understand for everyone.</dd>

             Leaders who show empathy are successful because they can better understand how the employees feel about their work environment. This enables the leaders to bring positive changes to the workforce.</dd>

<dt style="font-style: italic; font-size: 200%;"><strong>CRITICAL THINKING</strong></dt>
<ul>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Open-Mindedness:</li></dd>
         <dd>It’s important to kick off the critical thinking process with the idea that anything is possible. The more you’re able to set aside your own suspicions, beliefs, and agenda, 
             the better prepared you are to approach the situation with the level of inquisitiveness you need.</dd>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Observation:</li></dd>
         <dd>Observation is, of course, your ability to notice and process the details all around you (even the subtle or seemingly inconsequential ones). 
             Critical thinking demands that you’re flexible and willing to go beyond surface-level information, and solid observation skills help you do that.</dd>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Research:</li></dd>
         <dd>Critical thinking hinges on objectivity. And, to be objective, you need to base your judgments on the facts – which you collect through research. 
             You’ll lean on your research skills to gather as much information as possible that’s relevant to your problem or situation.</dd>
</ul>

<dt style="font-style: italic; font-size: 200%;"><strong>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</strong></dt>
<ul>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Self-Awareness:</li></dd>
         <dd>People with high emotional intelligence are usually very self-aware. They understand their emotions, and because of this, they don't let their feelings rule them. 
             They're confident – because they trust their intuition and don't let their emotions get out of control. They're also willing to take an honest look at themselves.</dd>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Self-Regulation:</li></dd>
         <dd>This is the ability to control emotions and impulses. People who self-regulate typically don't allow themselves to become too angry or jealous, and they don't make impulsive, careless decisions. They think before they act. 
             Characteristics of self-regulation are thoughtfulness, comfort with change, integrity, and the ability to say no.</dd>
    <dd style="font-family: Arial Black;"><li>Empathy:</li></dd>
         <dd>This is perhaps the second-most important element of emotional intelligence. Empathy is the ability to identify with and understand the wants, needs, and viewpoints of those around you. 
             People with empathy are good at recognizing the feelings of others, even when those feelings may not be obvious. As a result, empathetic people are usually excellent at managing relationships, listening, and relating to others. 
             They avoid stereotyping and judging too quickly, and they live their lives in a very open, honest way.</dd>
